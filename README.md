# Financial Report Generation and Summarization using NLP

This project aims to automate the process of generating and summarizing financial reports using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It helps in extracting, analyzing, and presenting key financial insights from structured or semi-structured data, making it easier for stakeholders to understand large volumes of financial information quickly.

---

## Features

- Extracts key financial metrics from input data (e.g., revenue, profit, expenses)
- Generates human-readable financial reports using NLP
- Provides concise summaries of lengthy financial documents
- Supports CSV, Excel, and textual financial input formats
- Basic sentiment analysis on financial statements

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**
- **spaCy**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visuals)**
- **Scikit-learn (if ML models are used)**
- **Streamlit / Flask** (if hosted as a web app)
